## Introduction

Make the looting experience more exciting!
This mod adds a rarity display to in-game items (based on their value), recalibrates search duration, and adds search sound effects.

Custom search sounds are now supported. Setup instructions:
1. Create a folder named ItemLevelAndSearchSoundMod in the game’s installation directory.
2. Place your sound files inside it — for example: 0.mp3 replaces the search sound for white rarity items. (1 = green, 2 = blue, 3 = purple, 4 = gold, 5 = light red, 6 = dark red)
3. Restart the game (if it’s currently running).

If there’s an issue loading the custom sounds, an error message will appear in red text at the top-left corner of the screen.

To disable the Mod's custom item search duration, simply create a file named `DisableModSearchTime.txt` in `<game installation directory>/ItemLevelAndSearchSoundMod/`.
